# üì¢ B2NL v6.1.1 Update - Detailed Status Report

## üî¨ Current Status (2025-09-21)

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Reconstruction - COMPLETE
- **Achievement**: 97.71% overall reconstruction rate
- **Test Languages**: 6 languages (Korean, English, Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Spanish)
- **Result**: 100% byte-exact reconstruction for ALL test languages
- **Training Time**: 100 hours on RTX 4070 (Epochs 1-50)

### üîÑ Phase 2: Compression - IN PROGRESS
- **Status**: Currently training (Epoch 51+)
- **Method**: Dynamic compression with adaptive ratios (1:1 to 50:1)
- **Algorithm**:
  - High reconstruction (>95%) ‚Üí Apply stronger compression (30-50:1)
  - Medium reconstruction (90-95%) ‚Üí Moderate compression (10-30:1)
  - Low reconstruction (<90%) ‚Üí Gentle compression (1-10:1)
- **Target**: 3:1 average compression while maintaining >95% reconstruction
- **Expected Results**: Next week (approximately 2025-09-28)

### üîÆ Phase 3: Optimization - PLANNED
- **Start**: After Phase 2 completion
- **Goals**:
  - Production optimization
  - 50K tokens/sec inference speed
  - 4-bit quantization (151MB model size)

## üìä Important Clarifications

### Current Scope
- **6 Languages First**: We're validating the approach with 6 diverse languages
- **NOT 204 yet**: The 204-language training will begin AFTER successful validation
- **Proof of Concept**: Current model proves the technology works

### Why 6 Languages First?
1. **Resource Constraints**: Limited to RTX 4070 (12GB VRAM)
2. **Validation Strategy**: Prove compression works before scaling
3. **Risk Mitigation**: Ensure quality before massive training

## üóìÔ∏è Timeline

### This Week (Sept 21-28, 2025)
- Phase 2 compression training continues
- Dynamic ratio adjustment (1-50:1)
- Monitoring compression vs reconstruction trade-off

### Next Week (Sept 28 - Oct 5, 2025)
- **Phase 2 Results Published**
- Compression ratio achievements
- Updated model with compression capability
- Decision on 204-language expansion

### Future (With GPU Support)
- 204-language full training
- FLORES-200 complete dataset
- Estimated time: 2 weeks on A100

## üìà Expected Phase 2 Outcomes

### Success Metrics
- **Compression**: 3:1 average (from current 1:1)
- **Reconstruction**: Maintain >95% accuracy
- **Languages**: All 6 test languages performing well

### What This Means
- 3x fewer tokens for same text
- 3x faster inference
- 3x lower memory usage

## üéØ Next Steps After Phase 2

### If Successful (>3:1 compression with >95% reconstruction):
1. Release v6.2 with compression
2. Apply for GPU grants with proven results
3. Begin 204-language training

### If Needs Adjustment:
1. Fine-tune compression ratios
2. Additional training epochs
3. Architecture adjustments

## üí° Technical Details

### Dynamic Compression Algorithm
```python
if reconstruction_accuracy > 0.95:
    compression_ratio = random.uniform(30, 50)
elif reconstruction_accuracy > 0.90:
    compression_ratio = random.uniform(10, 30)
else:
    compression_ratio = random.uniform(1, 10)
```

### Current Training Configuration
- Learning Rate: 1e-5 (reduced for stability)
- Batch Size: 16
- Gradient Accumulation: 4
- Effective Batch: 64
